### Cult of the Lamb is centered around a lamb who is tasked with forming a cult to appease the deity, The One Who Waits, who saved the player character's life. The player must launch roguelite-style crusades and venture out into the game's four regions to defeat enemies, called "heretics," and grow their following. The world, which is randomly generated and contains roguelite elements, contains resources to gather, perks and weapons to collect, enemies in the form of rival cultists and non-believers to fight, and other animals to rescue; these animals can be indoctrinated into the player's cult. They have appearances that can be changed and both positive and negative traits, which can affect how they act in the cult or how they react to the player's actions regarding the cult.
