# Cult-Of-The-Lamb
Cult of the Lamb is centered around a lamb who is tasked with forming a cult to appease the deity, The One Who Waits, who saved the player character's life. The player must launch roguelite-style crusades and venture out into the game's four regions to defeat enemies, called "heretics," and grow their following.
